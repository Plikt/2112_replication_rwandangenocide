Our code focuses on replicating the results of paper surrounding the identified microspatial variables in the Rwandan Genocide. We extend the findings using by narrowing their regression to focus on the causal instead of predictive question of how much these microspatial variables might be driving the increase in participation rates. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitivity of the model to unknown confounders.
