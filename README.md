This is a repository of all the statistical analysis projects I've completed as a part of my education at Minerva University. These topics span psychology, economics, and ecology. 

## Replication and Sensitivity Analysis of "Who Killed in Rwanda's Genocide" 
Replication code for "Who killed in Rwandaâ€™s genocide? Micro-space, social influence and individual participation in intergroup violence"

Our code focuses on replicating the results of paper surrounding the identified microspatial variables in the Rwandan Genocide. We extend the findings using by narrowing their regression to focus on the causal instead of predictive question of how much these microspatial variables might be driving the increase in participation rates. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis to determine the sensitivity of the model to unknown confounders.

## Exploring the Effects of Satoyama Silvergrass Management Using Fire and Cutting Methods. 
This project explores the effects of changing Silvergrass management techniques in small towns that maintain Japan's Satoyama landscape. 

Abstract: The world is being pulled three-directions towards industrializing food production to ensure sufficient and efficient supply, adopting sustainable agricultural practices that can ensure continued food production, and protecting cultural landscapes. The Satoyama landscape is a cultural practice that emphasizes the integration of agricultural and human activity with the natural environment and as a result produces sustainable, consistent yields (Kamada, 2017) that also support local biodiversity through the maintenance of a mosaic landscape (Katoh et al, 2009). However this landscape and the culture around it is disappearing as village populations age and young people move to cities. This changing demographic has altered agricultural practices such as the management of silvergrass through fire the labor costs of maintaining the landscape. We explore the effects of eliminating annual filed firing from the Satoyama management regime and in a randomized trial find that fire creates significantly higher quality silvergrass strands. We explore implications for cultural valuation of the Satoyama management practices.
