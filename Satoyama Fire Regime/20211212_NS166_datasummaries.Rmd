This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

##LIBRARY LOADING

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(gplots)
library(ggpubr)
```

##DATA LOADING AND NOTEBOOK SET UP 

```{r}

#Load the main raw dataset
sg_data <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\desot\\D\\20211218_NS166_project\\20211212_speciesrichdata.csv")

#data cleaning and conversion
sg_data$richness <- as.numeric(sg_data$richness)
sg_data$ï..date <- as.factor(sg_data$ï..date)
sg_data <- sg_data[-c(42,49,162,204,272),]
sg_data <- sg_data[sg_data$treat !="AP",]

#display the species data
head(sg_data)


#note on interpreting this data set. For ease of reading I have converted C to LB which indicates (L)eave all the biomass and (B)urn and 
#RL to CN which indicates (C)ut the silvergrass and (B)urn. 


```

##DATA CLEAN UP 

```{r}
#Separates the treatment variables for easy comparison

CB <- sg_data[sg_data$treat =="CB",]
NB <- sg_data[sg_data$treat =="NB",]
LB <- sg_data[sg_data$treat =="LB",]



```

#T-TESTS

```{r}

#understanding richness for burn, nonburn, and cut and burn
bvnb <- t.test(CB$richness, NB$richness)
bvc <- t.test(CB$richness, LB$richness)
cvnb <- t.test(LB$richness, NB$richness)

bvnb
bvc
cvnb

#t-tests for height across groups
heightbnb <- t.test(CB$avghcm, NB$avghcm)
heightbc <- t.test(CB$avghcm, LB$avghcm)
heighttc <- t.test(LB$avghcm, NB$avghcm)

heightbc
heightbnb
heighttc

#but we shouldn't use these -> realization I had. We have too many comparisions meaning error compounds and needs to be adjusted. 
#To deal with this we would do Bonferroni's or whatever but bc there are so many... seems like a lot. 


```

##ANOVA becuase I'm a bit dumb :)

```{r}

#An anova on the species richness - it ended up being significant which is interesting
richness <- aov(richness ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130614",])
summary(richness)

#Just because I was trying to figure out the dates I needed to use. 
unique(sg_data[c("ï..date")])

#Anova for each date with the height
height1 <- aov(avghcm ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130614",])
summary(height1)

height2 <- aov(avghcm ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130707",])
summary(height2)

height3 <- aov(avghcm ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130817",])
summary(height3)

height4 <- aov(avghcm ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130926",])
summary(height4)


#This displays the differences for the individual comparisions. 
TukeyHSD(height4)


#Coverage
cov1 <- aov(coverage ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130614",])
summary(height1)

cov2 <- aov(coverage ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130707",])
summary(height2)

cov3 <- aov(coverage ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130817",])
summary(height3)

cov4 <- aov(coverage ~ treat, data = sg_data[sg_data$ï..date == "20130926",])


TukeyHSD(cov1)
TukeyHSD(cov2)
TukeyHSD(cov3)
TukeyHSD(cov4)

#Demonstrates all the means by treatment type and date 
aggregate(x = sg_data,                                       # Specify data column
          by = list(sg_data$treat, sg_data$ï..date),         # Specify group indicator
          FUN = mean)                                        # Specify function (i.e. mean)
```

#PLOTS
```{r}


#Plots plots plots - plots fired!

#this ones demonstrates the heights over time for each of the three treatments
ggline(sg_data, x = "ï..date", y = "avghcm", 
       add = c("mean_se"),
       ylab = "Mean heights",
       xlab = "Dates",
       title = "Mean Silvergrass heights over time",
       color = "treat", palette = "jco")

#demonstrates the coverage over time for each of the three treatments. 
ggline(sg_data, x = "ï..date", y = "coverage", 
       add = c("mean_se"),
       ylab = "Mean Coverage",
       xlab = "Dates",
       title = "Mean Silvergrass coverage over time",
       color = "treat", palette = "jco")

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
